# Pact -  Integration testing done properly

> Fast, easy and reliable testing for integrating web apps, APIs and microservices

##  Say goodbye to end-to-end testing

> Testing microservices shouldn't involve setting up complex end-to-end test environments, creating lengthy integration suites and managing test data. Stop wasting time, and start releasing.
